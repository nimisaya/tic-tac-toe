# Tic Tac Toe

**Egg, Yolk, Chicken** is your opportunity to answer the age old question of what came first, Chicken or the Egg? If you can play Tic Tac Toe then you can play this! Battle it out against a friend and determine if chicken wins (came first) or egg does. Get a draw? I guess they came into existence at the same time.

## My experience developing the game
My experience can be summed up as doing 80% of the work in 20% of the time and fixing bugs the remaining 80% of the time.
